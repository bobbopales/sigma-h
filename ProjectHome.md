**Sigmah forge has migrated to GitHub: https://github.com/sigmah-dev/sigmah**
_The Google Code forge is only maintained temporarily for the [wiki](https://code.google.com/p/sigma-h/wiki/Index?tm=6)._

Sigmah is an open source, web-based project monitoring and management system for the UN, NGOs, and other actors working in emergency relief, post-conflict, and development fields.

Sigmah is based on [ActivityInfo v0.6](http://code.google.com/p/activity-info/) and succeeds [Dynamic COMPAS](http://sourceforge.net/projects/compasdyn).

For more information about Sigmah and its evolution, please visit **[www.sigmah.org](http://www.sigmah.org)**.

_P.S.:_ why is the Google Code project name written "sigma-h" and not "sigmah"? Well, "sigmah" is already taken by another project on Google Code, so we needed to adapt our name which is actually "Sigmah" to this constraint... :)
