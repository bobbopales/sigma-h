# Introduction #

This page lists and describes all the tools used for the communication within Sigmah project developers' community.

# New project contributors: where to register? #
When arriving on the project, a new developer is expected to register on the 2 following communication tools:
  * the [sigmah-dev](http://groups.google.com/group/sigmah-dev) mailing list
  * the Sigmah [issue tracker](http://www.sigmah.org/issues)


# Description of the community communication tools #

## 1. sigmah-dev: _the fundamental developer's mailing list_ ##

The **sigmah-dev** mailing list is the most important mean of communication within our Sigmah community. All developers must register to this mailing list. This list is used for all technical discussions.

**sigmah-dev** mailing list is a Google Group available at: http://groups.google.com/group/sigmah-dev

The public archives of sigmah-dev is also an important source of information. **sigmah-dev archives** are also available at: http://groups.google.com/group/sigmah-dev

## 2. Sigmah Issue Tracker: _the project management tool_ ##

Sigmah **issue tracker** (also known sometimes as Sigmah **bug tracker**, even though it contains as much new feature requests as bug reports) is the interface between the detailed expression of new needs and the technical solution developed to reply to them. Sigmah **issue tracker** is based on the open source Mantis Bug Tracking system.

In Sigmah **issue tracker**, each need (either the description of a new feature, or a report of bug) is described as a separate issue with a unique **issue number**. To each issue, a **target version** is attached. This target version is the version planned for the development of the solution to the issue. That way, the [project roadmap](http://www.sigmah.org/issues/roadmap_page.php) can be build, and developers can know what are the most urgent issues to develop.

Each issue can be assigned to a developer. That way, each developer can know on which issues he should work. As a consequence, each developer must create a user account on the Sigmah **issue tracker**.

**Sigmah issue tracker** is available at: http://www.sigmah.org/issues/


## 3. #sigmah IRC channel: _where we can chat live!_ ##

Sometimes, having a discussion by email is not enough interactive to progress... or not fun enough to get to know each other :)
The role of the #sigmah IRC channel is to provide a solution for live chat. When an conclusion is found during a discussion on the #sigmah IRC channel, this conclusion should be reported either in the discussed issue page on the issue tracker, or, if the subject was more general, to the whole sigmah-dev mailing list. This important for 2 reasons: that way, everybody will be kept informed, and moreover we will keep a log of the decision or the solution.


#sigmah IRC channel is available at the following URL: [irc://irc.freenode.net/sigmah](irc://irc.freenode.net/sigmah)
If you don't have an IRC client installed (such as [Pidgin](http://pidgin.im/)), you can use a web client available at http://webchat.freenode.net/ .
