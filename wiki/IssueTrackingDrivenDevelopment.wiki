= Issue-tracking driven development =
"Issue-tracking driven development" could be summarized as "tell what you'll do, and do what you've told".

The rule is simple and straightforward:
*All commits should be linked with an issue in the issue tracker.*

==How to link commits with issues?==
In order to ease this linkage process between the commit and the issue tracker, a script has been added. If strings like the following are included in the commit comment, the changeset of the commit will be automatically added to the issue details:
 * *`issue #45`* _(with a #, it also creates an hyperlink to the issue in the issue details)_
 * `issue 45`
 * `Issue 45`
 * `ISSuE #45` _(with a #, it also creates an hyperlink to the issue in the issue details)_
 * `issue 0000045`

==How to close an issue directly in the commit?==
It is possible to mark an issue status as "resolved" and its resolution as "fixed" automatically by putting a string like the following in the commit comment:
 * *`fixes issue #45`* _(with a #, it also creates an hyperlink to the issue in the issue details)_
 * `Fixes issue 45`
 * `FIXES Issue 45`
 * `FiXeS ISSuE #45` _(with a #, it also creates an hyperlink to the issue in the issue details)_
 * `fixeS issue 0000045`
