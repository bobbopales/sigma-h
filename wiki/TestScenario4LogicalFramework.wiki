=== _Title:_ Create a minimal logframe without indicators ===
|| *#* || *Steps to reproduce* || *Expected result* ||
|| 1 || From the Main dashboard, create a new project from the model « Contrat de financement v1 » (code and title free to choose).||The new project gets available in the Projects table (visible only if table is grouped by « Source of Funding project".||
|| 2 ||Open the new project.||A new tab opens up in the application with the new project.||
|| 3 ||Open the « Log frame » sub-tab of this new project.||A screen with an empty logical framework is displayed. The title of the project should appear at the upper-left part of the logical frame. ||
|| 4 || Modify the content of the Main objective, and click on the « Add » button of the « Specific objectives » row.||This first specific objective gets code « SO A. »  and the cells « Intervention logic » and « Risks and assumptions » become open for modification.||
|| 5 ||Enter any data in the « Intervention logic » and « Risks and assumptions » cells for this specific objective, and click on the « Add » button of the « Expected result » row.||A popup opens up asking you to choose a parent specific objective for this expected result.||
|| 6 ||Select « SO A. » and click on « Save".||This first expected result gets code « ER A.1. »  and the cells « Intervention logic » and « Risks and assumptions » become open for modification for this row.||
|| 7 ||Enter any data in the « Intervention logic » and « Risks and assumptions » cells for this expected result, and click on the « Add » button of the « Activities » row.||A popup opens up asking you to choose a parent expected result, a start and end dates for this new activity.||
|| 8 ||Select « ER A.1. » and choose any date and click on « Save".||This first expected result gets code « A A.1.1. »  and the cell « Intervention logic » becomes open for modification for this row.||
|| 9 ||Enter any data in the « Intervention logic » cell for this activity, and click on the « Add » button of the « Prerequisites » row.||This first prerequisite gets code « P 1. »  and the a long cell « Intervention logic » becomes open for modification for this row.||
|| 10 ||Enter any data in the « Intervention logic » cell for this prequisite, and click on the « Save » button of this screen. ||You get a confirmation message that your data has been correctly saved, and the « Save » button becomes disabled.||
|| 11 ||Close the project dashboard, reopen the project and come back to this « Log frame » sub-tab.||All the data you've entered are still here.||


== LF3 ==
=== _Title:_ Create indicators in a logframe ===
|| *#* || *Steps to reproduce* || *Expected result* ||
|| 1 || Opens the « Log frame » sub-tab of any project which has already an empty logframe, or create a new project and opens its « Log frame ». ||A screen with a logical framework is displayed.||
|| 2 || For each row of the logframe (Specific objectives, Expected results, Activities), create a logframe element with at least one element with a long name (more than 50 characters), and create a new indicator by clicking accordingly on the « New indicator » hyperlink and filling all indicators attributes. ||In each row, an indicator should be visible with its name in the « Indicators » column, and its source of verification in the « Means of verification » column.||
|| 3 || Click on the « Save » button of this screen.|| You get a confirmation message that your data has been correctly saved, and the « Save » button becomes disabled.||
|| 4 || Go to the « Manage indicators » sub-tab. || All the indicators you've created in the logframe are also listed here, with their target values and all attributes.||
|| 5 || Go back to the « Log frame » sub-tab. || All the data you've entered previously are still here.||
|| 6 || Modify a cell in the logframe (like the title of a specific objective) and click on the « Save » button of this screen.|| You get a confirmation message that your data has been correctly saved, and the « Save » button becomes disabled. ||
|| 7 || Go to the « Manage indicators » sub-tab. || All the indicators you've created in the logframe are still listed here, with their target values and all attributes still similar as what they used to be.||

=== _Title:_ Move an element of a logical frame ===
|| *#* || *Steps to reproduce* || *Expected result* ||
|| 1 || Opens the « Log frame » sub-tab of any project which has a log frame that has 3 elements of the same type. ||A screen with a logical framework is displayed.||
|| 2 ||Click on the icon with the arrow going down next to the element in the middle. || A contextual menu should appear. ||
|| 3 || Click on « Up » or « Down » and click on « Save ». || The element is moved accordingly to the choice you have made.||
|| 4 || Close and reopen the project dashboard and come back to the « Log frame » sub-tab. || The element should be in the same position that he was after you moved it. ||

== LF5 ==
=== _Title:_ Delete an element from a logical frame ===
|| *#* || *Steps to reproduce* || *Expected result* ||
|| 1 || Opens the « Log frame » sub-tab of any project which has already a minimal logframe you're ready to modify. ||A screen with a logical framework is displayed.||
|| 2 || Click on the icon with the arrow going down next to an element in the log frame that doesn't have any depending element (like activity). || A contextual menu should appear. ||
|| 3 || Click on « Delete ». || The element should disappear. ||
